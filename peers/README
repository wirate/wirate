Peers declarations

Each peer is a directory, containing textfiles of _what_ it may support or not.

Whould you want to mount a remote peer, e.g. using sshfs, 
then create a mnt/sshfs/root/ dir and mount it there 
(this way you can mount the host in multiple ways in paralell).
Should you want to mount a peer, with different mount points, 
create subdirs with a descriptive names. (root here is just an example)
