This dir is intended to _only_ point out which modules are active.

A set of symlinks to respective modules conf-scripts.

Confs should share format and begin with some module declaration.

Don't forget to add the actual confscripts to ".gitignore" so you don't accidently share secrets. Each conf dir should contain an example configurationscript.
